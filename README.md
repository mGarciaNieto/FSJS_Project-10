## Project Overview

In this final project, I've used React to create a client for my existing school database REST API (which I had created in a previous project). This full stack application provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users could interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing details for a specific course, as well as creating, updating, and deleting courses in the database.

Additionally, my project required users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. Implementing these features pushed my React skills to new heights.

To complete this project, I've used my knowledge of React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

After using the Create React App tool to set up my initial project, I:

- Used JavaScript and JSX to build out the components for my application in a modular fashion.
- Utilized React Router to set up my routes.
- Employed the Fetch API or a tool like Axios to fetch data from my REST API.
- Allowed users to sign up and utilized basic authentication to support users signing in.
- Added to the supplied CSS to personalize my project.

## To run the project

**First**, install the respective dependencies of the project in two different terminals, **api** and **client**:
`npm install`

**Next**, create the database and seed it with initial data in the **api** terminal:
`npm run seed`

**Finally**, launch the application in both terminals:
`npm start`

**Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser**

http://localhost:3000 (client) and http://localhost:5000 (api)
